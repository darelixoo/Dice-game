Dice Game ðŸŽ²
A fun, interactive game where players roll a dice and try to match their chosen number to increase their score. Built with React.js and styled-components for a seamless gaming experience.

In my Dice Game project, the initial screen features a "Play Now" button that the player can click to start the game. The total score begins at 0. Once the game starts, the player is prompted to select 
a number between 1 and 6. After making a selection, the player rolls the dice. If the rolled number matches the player's selected number, the total score increases by that number. However, if the rolled number 
does not match the selected number, the total score decreases by that number.

This gameplay mechanism creates an engaging experience, as players must carefully choose their numbers to maximize their scores while taking risks with each roll of the dice.
